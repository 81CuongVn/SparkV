<!-- About -->
# About
Ch1ll Studios is a business where the only time where we'll get money is when our users are happy. Ch1ll Studios is the proud owner of Ch1llBlox. We also make games on the platform, [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com).

## About Ch1llBlox
Ch1llBlox is a bot that has over 50+ commands and no commands that cost money. Our goal is to have over 400 commands with the one time price of $0.

## Why I made Ch1llBlox
I am always using Discord bots. Whether it's banning a bad actor to listening to music in a Voice Chat. But, I always run into a problem and that problem is that most commands with that select bot cost money. When making my bot, I kept in mind this bot would not have a single thing that would cost money to gain a benifit(s).
