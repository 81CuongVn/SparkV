Ch1ll Studios is the proud owner of Ch1llBlox. We also make games on the platform, [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com).\n\n## About Ch1llBlox\nCh1llBlox is a bot that has over 50+ commands and no commands that cost money. Our goal is to have over 400 commands with the one time price of $0.\n\n## Why I made Ch1llBlox\nI am always using Discord bots. Whether it's banning a bad actor to listening to music in a Voice Chat. But, I always run into a problem and that problem is that most commands with that select bot cost money. When making my bot, I kept in mind this bot would not have a single thing that would cost money to gain a benifit(s).\n\n# Support\nIf you aquire help, we ask that you join our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/PPtzT8Mu3h) on [Discord](https://discord.com).\n\n# Ch1ll Studios's Website License\nDistributed under the Apache-2.0 License.
