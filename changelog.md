# Changelog

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/Ch1ll-Studio/SparkV/compare/v1.1...v2) - 1-24-2022

## Hiya guys! Introducing... drum roll please :drum:... SparkV v2!

As the year of 2021 ended, I realized how awful SparkV's experience to the user truly is. And I promised myself I would revamp it in 2022. Welp, I can now say 23 days into 2022 v2 is finally ready for release!

## :eyes: **QUICK LOOK**
:crystal_ball: | First up, we added a whopping **45 NEW SLASH COMMAND ENABLED COMMANDS**! As Discord Slash commands are the future, we will be moving towards the future as well. Any new/updated commands will be slash enabled **ONLY**.

:sunglasses: | Second, We added new custom icons to make SparkV look very user-friendly! We also redid TONS of commands.

## **NEW/UPDATED CATEGORIES**
### üí∏ Economy Commands!
* UPDATED: ICONS!
* :new:: Coinflip - Flip a coin and bet on a side. If you win, you get double the money you bet on. 
* UPDATED: Balance - Now shows wallet and bank side by side!
* UPDATED: Daily - Ui Update/Changes
* UPDATED: Deposit/Withdraw - Now slash command only to prevent bugs!
* UPDATED: Rob Command - Looking much sicker!

### üß∞ Utility Commands!
* UPDATED: ICONS!
* UPDATED: Avatar (Cmd) - Download in multiple different sizes and formats!
* :new:: ServerInfo - Get the current server's info, or ANY server's info from it's invite link!
